## Mobile app to provide easy access to 24/7 counselling services for people in need
When tasked with the problem statement given to us for this hackathon, we realised that during the COVID-19 period, people may get lonely and depressed and need somebody to talk to. Unfortunately, we realised there were not many appplications that did this, hence we wanted to create it. 

The app provides an easy to use and gentle interface in order to soothe the user. The user can easily pick up their mobile phone and approach a counsellor in less then 3 steps. 

- 1. Open the app and choose guest login
- 2. Enter a few words or sentences to describe their feelings and emotions
- 3. Wait a few minutes, up to 5, for a counsellor to open a consultation either via call or text chat

The words input by the user will allow the counsellor to better understand the user and know how to help them best. 

The feature of a guest login allows a user to easily access a counsellor without going through tedious steps to register an account. This is gentler and easier on their already fragile and negative emotions.

After a consultation, the guest user has the option to create an account, which will allow us to better cater to him in the future. With a registered account, counsellors can write notes about each user, this will allow them to identify the same user in the future, or have an easier hand off to another counsellor without going back to square one.

Counsellors on this platform will be qualified and from collaborating organizations such as Samaritans of Singapore.
