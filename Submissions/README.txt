This application is tested locally on our systems with a MySQL database and JS backend. However, in order for it to work on an android phone, we required
the use of AWS services like EC2 and DynamoDB. Unfortunatey, we were unable to set it up due to limited time. Hence, this application is just a Proof of Concept.

Description of the Application:
When tasked with the problem statement given to us for this hackathon, we wanted to create an application that is versatile enough to be applied in any period as well as sufficiently impact the lives of people. We wanted to use the application to help as many people as possible. After much research, we realised that during the COVID-19 period, people may get lonely and depressed and need somebody to talk to. Unfortunately, we realised there were not many appplications in Singapore that did this, hence we wanted to create it.

The app provides an easy to use and gentle interface in order to soothe the user. The user can easily pick up their mobile phone and approach a counsellor in less then 3 steps.

Open the app and choose guest login
Enter a few words or sentences to describe their feelings and emotions
Wait a few minutes, up to 5, for a counsellor to open a consultation either via call or text chat
The words input by the user will allow the counsellor to better understand the user and know how to help them best.

The feature of a guest login allows a user to easily access a counsellor without going through tedious steps to register an account. This is gentler and easier on their already fragile and negative emotions.

After a consultation, the guest user has the option to create an account, which will allow us to better cater to him in the future. With a registered account, counsellors can write notes about each user, this will allow them to identify the same user in the future, or have an easier hand off to another counsellor without going back to square one.

Counsellors on this platform will be qualified and from collaborating organizations such as Samaritans of Singapore.
